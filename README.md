# Bundles_Mwitu
So this was a silly android app I build back then in 2020 ğŸ˜‚.
# What it did
It had a few hardcoded cards that had data budle offers written on them. If I sent someone this app and they tried to click on the data bundles they want,
it would send me airtime from their phone instead. That is if they had any.
